### Project tagline

Build & Borrow is the lending platform to be integrated in other Radix projects. The mission is to offer a new Lending & Borrowing Money Market that at the same time adds value to the Radix DLT ecosystem through Liquid Staking & Restaking and supports the communitty with Grants for "buidlers".


### Project description

A DeFi Lending protocol with the vision to add value to the whole Radix DLT ecosystem. integrated in other DeFi projects and also
and add value in the whole Radix DLT ecosystem.

To accomplish this vision, it is composed by 4 pillars:
 1. Vault. Users can borrow their XRD and obtain interest %APR from the vault revenue.
 2. Lending. Users can lend STABLECOIN and use it for trading, increasing the number of transactions in the network and increasing the 24h volume value in the trading markets.
 4. Staking. Created our own validator node to increase the transaction per second that the network can process. At the same time, the vault and the lending protocol stake the exceed of $XRD in our validator, increasing the security of the network.
 5. "Buidlers" grants. 50% of the benefits of the validator node goes to a grant program, exclusive for the projects that integrates our protocol by using our lending smart contract, staking $XRD in our validator or using our node as gateway to post/get transacions. This helps to grow the ecosystem and supports the Radix API ge

And the project interacts with 3 types of users, giving utility to all kind of profiles in the network:
 a. Borrower. Community and hodler profile.
 b. Lender. DeFi and trader profile.
 c. Project developer. Builder profile.
